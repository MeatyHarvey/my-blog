## üîß Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Basic Setup (Local Storage Only)
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Everything will work with local storage
3. View counts and comments will persist in browser storage

### Option 2: Full Setup with Firebase (Recommended)
1. **Create a Firebase project**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Firestore Database

2. **Update Firebase configuration**:
   - Open `js/firebase-config.js`
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase config:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
       authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
       projectId: "your-project-id",
       storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
       messagingSenderId: "123456789",
       appId: "your-app-id"
   };
   ```

3. **Set up Firestore security rules** (in Firebase Console):
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Allow read/write access to comments and views
       match /comments/{document} {
         allow read, write: if true;
       }
       match /views/{document} {
         allow read, write: if true;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
