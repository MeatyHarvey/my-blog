                <p>I had a discussion with Bok Han about my desire to become a special person. He asked me to define what it means to be special. To ensure I don't forget, I'm noting down some concepts here.</p>
                
                <p>Firstly, a special person possesses extensive knowledge in their areas of interest, enabling them to speak confidently and accurately on those topics. Secondly, a special person maintains a motivated mindset, consistently pushing themselves to improve both personally and professionally. Thirdly, a special person should embody the qualities of someone like Hikigaya, who doesn't conform to societal expectations and instead reminds themselves that they are better than the negative influences around them. They resist the urge to follow others and avoid becoming like them. Lastly, a special person achieves noteworthy results in their work, making a positive impact on people's lives and influencing their habits. The work they do should be seen as valuable and necessary for the future.</p>
                
                <p>My aspiration to become a special person stems from my desire not to be worthless or insignificant. I aim to be a useful individual whom others will rely on in the future.</p>
