            <p class="post-meta">Published on October 26, 2024 by Harvey</p>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I've been reflecting on the kind of life I want to lead while I'm in Korea. Observing those who are 25 or 26 and still in their third year of university, I realize that at 19, I'm the youngest among the exchange students. This is quite normal in Hong Kong, but it makes me wonder what my life will be like at their age.</p>
                
                <p>With so much uncertainty about my future, I aspire to be someone special. I dream of working at EMSD, becoming financially successful, and buying a house in Hong Kong. I hope to marry someone wonderful and eventually purchase a home in Japan, where we can spend a few months each year. By the time I'm 28 or 29, I want to have a child and provide them with a quality education in Hong Kong, just like I had. I hope they attend a top school, go to CUHK, and become an even better person than I am. I wish them all the success in the world.</p>
                
                <p>When my child goes to university, my future spouse and I plan to move to our house in Japan. By 2050, I'll be 46, and my parents will be 76. I want to take care of them and enjoy life in Japan. To me, this is a successful life because I'll be happy, wealthy, and surrounded by loved ones.</p>
                
                <p>However, I feel lost right now. I'm not excelling in my studies, and I'm uncertain if I'll pass all my courses during this exchange. I worry about securing an internship in my third year, and I'm unsure if I'll need to defer my studies because of this exchange. I'm anxious about finding a job after graduation. This uncertainty leaves me feeling confused, scared, and worried about my future.</p>
